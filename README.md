# regex_custom_route_summary
A script I wrote for fixing inaccurate route summaries where the suburbs were not contiguous.

Title: Custom Route Summary Script

Instructions:
    
1) Go to this website: https://repl.it/languages/python3
    
2) Copy and paste the code below (everything from line 32 onwards, inclusive) into the white space
   in the middle.
    
3) Paste the route summary you want to fix up
   in between the triple quotes, 
   as per the example below, with no spaces before
   the first road name or after the last suburb. 

4) Click 'run'.

5) The corrected route summary will appear in the terminal on the right-hand side
   of the screen.
   Highlight that text, copy it, then paste it back into the custom route
   summary in the portal.
