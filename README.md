# regex_custom_route_summary
A script I wrote for fixing inaccurate route summaries where the suburbs are not contiguous.

"""
title: Custom Route Summary Script
author: David Smith
created: 17/11/2019

Instructions:

1) Go to this website: https://repl.it/languages/python3
    
2) Copy and paste the code below (everything from line 34 onwards, inclusive) into the white space
   in the middle.

3) Paste the route summary you want to fix up
   in between the triple quotes,
   as per the example below, with no spaces before
   the first road name or after the last suburb.
   
   Please also delete the first line containing 'Start: ' and
   the end line containing 'End: '

4) Click 'run'.

5) The corrected route summary will appear in the terminal on the right-hand side
   of the screen.
   
   Highlight that text, copy it, then paste it back into the custom route
   summary in the portal.

If you have any feedback for me (e.g. 'It doesn't bloody work!'), I'd love to hear it.
